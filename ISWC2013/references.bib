	switching on an exception's class. Crucial to these mechanisms, in
	typed languages, is type refinement: The static type system will
	use type dispatch to refine types in successful branches. Considerable
	previous work has addressed type case constructs for structural type
	systems without subtyping, but these do not extend to named type
	systems with subtyping, as is common in object oriented languages.
	Previous work on type dispatch in named type systems with subtyping
	has not addressed its implementation formally.This paper describes
	a number of type dispatch constructs that share a common theme: class
	cast and class case constructs in object oriented languages, ML style
	exceptions, hierarchical extensible sums, and multimethods. I describe
	a unifying mechanism, tagging, that abstracts the operation of these
	constructs, and I formalise a small tagging language. After discussing
	how to implement the tagging language, I present a typed language
	without type dispatch primitives, and a give a formal translation

  abstract = {The World Wide Web has enabled the creation of a global information
	space comprising linked documents. As the Web becomes ever more enmeshed
	with our daily lives, there is a growing desire for direct access
	to raw data not currently available on the Web or bound up in hypertext
	documents. Linked Data provides a publishing paradigm in which not
	only documents, but also data, can be a first class citizen of the
	Web, thereby enabling the extension of the Web with a global data
	space based on open standards - the Web of Data. In this Synthesis
	lecture we provide readers with a detailed technical introduction
	to Linked Data. We begin by outlining the basic principles of Linked
	Data, including coverage of relevant aspects of Web architecture.
	The remainder of the text is based around two main themes - the publication
	and consumption of Linked Data. Drawing on a practical Linked Data
	scenario, we provide guidance and best practices on: architectural
	approaches to publishing Linked Data; choosing {URIs} and vocabularies
	to identify and describe resources; deciding what data to return
	in a description of a resource on the Web; methods and frameworks
	for automated linking of data sets; and testing and debugging approaches
	for Linked Data deployments. We give an overview of existing Linked
	Data applications and then examine the architectures that are used
	to consume Linked Data from the Web, alongside existing tools and
	frameworks that enable these. Readers can expect to gain a rich technical
	understanding of Linked Data fundamentals, as the basis for application
	development, research or further study.},

	in the presence of object references, methods, and subclassing is
	difficult. This paper describes a methodology for specifying and
	verifying object-oriented programs, using object invariants to specify
	the consistency of data and using ownership to organize objects into
	contexts. The novelty is that contexts can be dynamic: there is no
	bound on the number of objects in a context and objects can be transferred
	between contexts. The invariant of an object is allowed to depend
	on the fields of the object, on the fields of all objects in transitively-owned
	contexts, and on fields of objects reachable via given sequences
	of fields. With these invariants, one can describe a large variety
	of properties, including properties of cyclic data structures. Object
	invariants can be declared in or near the classes whose fields they
	depend on, not necessarily in the class of an owning object. The
	methodology is designed to allow modular reasoning, even in the presence
	of subclasses, and is proved sound.}

  abstract = {Separation of concerns and loose coupling of concerns are important
	issues in software enginnering. In this paper we show how to separate
	traversal-related concerns from other concerns, how to loosely couple
	traversal-related concerns to the structural concern, and how to
	efficiently implement traversal-related concerns. The stress is on
	the detailed description of our algorithms and the traversal specifications
	they operate on.Traversal of object structures is a ubiquitous routine
	in most types of information processing. Ad hoc implementations of
	traversals lead to scattered and tangled code and in this paper we
	present a new approach, called traversal strategies, to succinctly
	modularize traversals. In our approach traversals are defined using
	a high-level directed graph description, which is compiled into a
	dynamic road map to assist run-time traversals. The complexity of
	the compilation algorithm is polynomial in the size of the traversal
	strategy graph and the class graph of the given application. Prototypes
	of the system have been developed and are being successfully used
	to implement traversals for Java and AspectJ [Kiczales et al. 2001]
	and for generating adapters for software components. Our previous
	approach, called traversal specifications [Lieberherr 1992; Palsberg
	et al. 1995], was less general and less succinct, and its compilation
	algorithm was of exponential complexity in some cases. In an additional
	result we show that this bad behavior is inherent to the static traversal
	code generated by previous implementations, where traversals are
	carried out by invoking methods without parameters.}

	can be defined by the strategic programmer using a combinator style

@inproceedings{mei06,
  abstract = {Many software applications today need to handle data from different data models; typically objects from the host programming language along with the relational and XML data models. The ROX impedance mismatch makes programs awkward to write and hard to maintain. The .NET Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) framework, proposed for the next release of the .NET framework, approaches this problem by defining a pattern of general-purpose standard query operators for traversal, filter, and projection. Based on this pattern, any .NET language can define special query comprehension syntax that is subsequently compiled into these standard operators (our code examples are in VB). Besides the general query operators, the LINQ framework also defines two domain specific APIs that work over XML (XLinq) and relational data (DLinq) respectively. The operators over XML use a lightweight and easy to use in-memory XML representation to provide XQuery-style expressiveness in the host programming language. The operators over relational data provide a simple OR mapping by leveraging remotable queries that are executed directly in the back-end relational store.},
